README.txt

All contents of this program have been compacted into one jar file for ease of running.

To run the program, ensure that the "data" and "output" directories are included within the same directory as SMSSpam.jar. The "data" directory should contain the necessary data files: "hamtrain.txt", "hamtest.txt", "spamtrain.txt", "spamtest.txt". To run the jar on Windows, use the following command: "java -jar SMSSpam.jar".

Once run, the program will prompt for various user input.

Note that a Java and JRE version of 1.8.0 or higher are required to run the JAR!
